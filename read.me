1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, querySelector, querySelectorAll

getElementById is used to select only ONE element using its unique id.
getElementsByClassName is used to select multiple elements that share the same class name.
querySelector is more Flexible because it uses CSS selectors and returns only the first matching element.
querySelectorAll also uses CSS selectors but returns ALL matching elements as a list.

2. Creating a new element in the DOM

To create a new element in the DOM, we first use document.createElement().
After creating it, we can add text, attributes or classes, then insert it into the page using methods like appendChild() or similar functions.

3. Event Bubbling

Event bubbling means when an event happens on a child element, it moves upward step by step to its Parent elements.
For example, if a button inside a div is clicked, the event runs on the button first, then the div, then the body. This process continues upward.

4. Event Delegation

Event delegation means attaching one event listener to a parent element instead of adding listeners to every child element.
The parent listens to events that bubble up from its children and handles them.
This makes the code cleaner and also improves performance in many cases.

5. preventDefault() vs stopPropagation()

preventDefault() stops the browser’s default behaviour, like stopping a form from submitting or preventing a link from opening.
stopPropagation() stops the event from moving upward to parent elements, so the Bubbling process stops there.
